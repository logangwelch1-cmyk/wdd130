        <h3>Client Report</h3>
        <p>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan? I used AI to help generate some images and content ideas. Most of it was from the ideas I had beforehand. My dev suggested some extra images and it helped a lot.</p>
        <p>How did you communicate with your developer? Email mostly although he wasn't in class often he was very responsive over email.</p>
        <p>Was there any issues with communication? Not really, once we got going.</p>
        <p>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site? Yes, I think more could have been done but for the time frame it was good.</p>
        <p>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you? I would do research on the devs beforehand to make sure they are a good fit.</p>

        <h3>Lead Dev Report</h3>
        <p>How did you manage your development team and communicate the tasks for your junior devs? Mostly through in person meetings and some over email.</p>
        <p>How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues? In class I took him weeks to get me a site plan.</p>
        <p>How did you handle publishing your client's site and sharing it with the client? I used GitHub pages to publish the site and shared the link with the client while showing him the changes made in class.</p>
        <p>How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub? Not bad, I am still learning but it's getting easier.</p>

        <h3>Junior Dev Report</h3>
        <p>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues? He was slow to respond and never made a front page or CSS. We were supposed to use Discord. For the other he was very attentive and reached out a few times. The site plan I received had no sub pages.</p>
